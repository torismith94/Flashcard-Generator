# Flashcard-Generator

This generator is the backend for a basic flashcard application. The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards: 

**Basic** flashcards which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

**Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)
